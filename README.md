# Introduction

## What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a method that integrates retrieval systems with generative AI, enabling chatbots to access recent and specific information from external sources.

By using a retrieval pipeline, the chatbot can fetch up-to-date, relevant data and combine it with the generative model’s language capabilities, producing responses that are both accurate and contextually enriched. This makes RAG particularly useful for applications requiring fact-based, real-time knowledge delivery.
